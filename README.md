# SPES
Presentation of my project: the video game SPES.

It's a project aimed at targeting the creation of an old-school RPG game.

It is created in Python using the Pygame module, and my goal is to prove that video game development is much simpler than it seems.

I would use VSCode for programming, Aseprite for visuals, ChipTone for sound effects, Reaper for music, and I wouldn't need anything else.

This project will also present many points that I will take great care to explain, such as neural network for pseudo-randomness specific to the game (without the random module) and many others.

Thank you for the attention you can give to my project.👌🐺
